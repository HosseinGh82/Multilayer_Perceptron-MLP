# üß† Simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) from Scratch

This project demonstrates the implementation of a basic Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network from scratch using Python. We will build the essential components of a neural network, including tensors, operations like addition and multiplication, a simple optimizer, and an automatic differentiation mechanism to enable backpropagation. We will then use this MLP model to classify data generated by `make_blobs` from the `sklearn.datasets` library.

## üåü Introduction

The project is divided into several stages:

1. **Defining Tensors**: Building the foundational data structure to store values and gradients.
2. **Operations on Tensors**: Implementing basic operations like addition, multiplication, and activation functions with automatic differentiation.
3. **Building the MLP Architecture**: Creating neurons, layers, and the overall MLP model.
4. **Training the Model**: Implementing the training loop with forward and backward passes.
5. **Evaluating the Model**: Visualizing the loss over epochs and testing the MLP on a synthetic dataset.

üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details
1. Defining Tensors
The Tensor class is the foundational data structure in this project. Each tensor holds a value, a gradient, and the connections (children) in the computational graph. Various operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and power are implemented, each with their respective backward functions for gradient computation.

2. Operations on Tensors
The project implements basic operations (e.g., addition, multiplication) with automatic differentiation, enabling backpropagation. The backward method propagates gradients from the output back through the computational graph.

3. Building the MLP Architecture
The MLP model is built using three classes:

Neuron: Represents a single neuron with weights and a bias.
Layer: Consists of multiple neurons.
MLP: Combines multiple layers to form the complete neural network.
4. Training the Model
The training loop includes forward and backward passes, where the model's parameters are updated using a simple Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer. The loss function used is Mean Squared Error (MSE).

5. Evaluating the Model
The model's performance is visualized by plotting the loss over epochs, which helps in understanding the training progress.

üß™ Testing with a Synthetic Dataset
The MLP model is tested on a synthetic dataset generated using make_blobs from sklearn.datasets. The dataset consists of 1000 samples with 3 centers (classes) and 2 features. The model is trained for 100 epochs, and the loss is plotted to visualize its progression over time.

python
Copy code
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate synthetic dataset
X, y = make_blobs(n_samples=1000, centers=3, n_features=2, random_state=0)

# Plot the dataset
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=y)
plt.show()
